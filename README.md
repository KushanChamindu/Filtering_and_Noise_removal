## Filtering_and_Noise_removal
Implementation of linear filtering and noise filtering for the computer vision module

#### Linear Filtering
Contains a function that implements a 3x3 linear filter on a grey-scale image of NxM pixels. The function takes the following as inputs.

The filter 3x3 filter mask as a 3x3 integer array
Input image
* A parameter specifying how the edge pixels should be treated
* O- omit edge pixels
* S- shrink filter at edges
* P-pad the image with black white coloured pixels
* R-replicate edge rows
* W-wrap the image

Noise Filtering
Contains following noise filters. Used image wrapping for the edge pixels. Programme automatically read all JPG/JPEG files in the directory and produce filtered image.

Mean filter
Median filter
Mid-point filter

Implementation Details
Open CV library only for read/write the image file.
